Task 4: Review NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) & Risk Management Framework (RMF)


## NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 Summary
The NIST CSF 2.0 is a voluntary framework designed to help organizations manage and reduce cybersecurity risks. It provides a flexible, risk-based approach to improving cybersecurity posture across industries. Key components include:

### Core Functions
Organized into six functions—**Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover**—that provide a high-level view of cybersecurity activities:
- **Govern**: Establishes cybersecurity strategy, policies, and oversight.
- **Identify**: Understand assets, risks, and vulnerabilities.
- **Protect**: Implement safeguards to mitigate risks.
- **Detect**: Monitor and identify cybersecurity events.
- **Respond**: Take action during and after a cybersecurity incident.
- **Recover**: Restore operations and resilience post-incident.

### Implementation Tiers
Range from **Tier 1 (Partial)** to **Tier 4 (Adaptive)**, helping organizations assess their cybersecurity maturity and progress.

### Profiles
Customized alignment of the framework to organizational goals, risk tolerance, and resources.

### Emphasis on Governance
CSF 2.0 introduces a stronger focus on governance, ensuring cybersecurity is integrated into organizational decision-making.

### Applicability
Expanded to address organizations of all sizes and sectors, including critical infrastructure and beyond.

## NIST SP 800-37 Risk Management Framework (RMF) Summary
The RMF provides a structured process for integrating security and risk management into federal information systems. It is a key component of the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) compliance. Key steps include:

1. **Prepare**: Establish context and priorities for managing security and privacy risks.
2. **Categorize**: Classify information systems based on impact levels (low, moderate, high).
3. **Select**: Choose appropriate security controls from NIST SP 800-53.
4. **Implement**: Deploy and document controls.
5. **Assess**: Evaluate control effectiveness through testing and audits.
6. **Authorize**: Senior officials make risk-based decisions to authorize system operation.
7. **Monitor**: Continuously track control performance and risks.

The RMF emphasizes a lifecycle approach, ensuring continuous monitoring and adaptation to evolving threats.

## Key Takeaways
- **CSF 2.0**: Focuses on governance, flexibility, and broad applicability for managing cybersecurity risks.
- **RMF**: Provides a detailed, step-by-step process for federal agencies to manage risks and ensure compliance.
- Both frameworks emphasize **risk-based approaches**, **continuous improvement**, and **integration of cybersecurity into organizational processes**.
